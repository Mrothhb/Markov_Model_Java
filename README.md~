#Program Description
The MarkovModel program is based on the concept by the algorithm invented by 
the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov. The algorithm is used for decision 
making processes and is regarding for its "memorylessness decision making. 
The program will use the Markov decision making process to generate a sequence
of words based on words taken from a text file. The words in the text file will
be used as prefix words for prediction words that come right after the prefix. 
The program will generate a specific amount of prediction words based on the 
given degree of words
